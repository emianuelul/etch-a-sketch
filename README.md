# etch-a-sketch

Small project done to put into practice the stuff I learned.

### Mainly a bit of CSS (though very basic since that wasn't the main focus), some HTML and JavaScript.

## What I learned:

1. DOM manipulation through JS
2. Handling event listeners

## How to use:

- Click inside the canvas to paint.
- To clear the canvas, click the 'Clear Canvas' button.
- To resize the canvas, click the 'Resize Canvas' button.
  - Input a number between 1 and 128 inside the prompt :
    - If it's greater than 128 it will default to 128;
    - If it's less than 1 it will default to 1;
    - If propmt is dismissed, the canvas won't reset.
- Crazy Mode makes it so that when you paint, the colors are randomized.
